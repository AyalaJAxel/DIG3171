<p> Play if you think you have what it takes! </p>

  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>The objective with this narrative was to place the reader into the high-pressure scenarios officials get placed in when enacting policy regarding environmental issues, which, specifically, I chose to address air pollution as an example. Twine served as the best tool to convey this concept due to its branching nature coinciding well with choice based consequences being demonstrated. Though this was done through a highly simplified lens, the objective is met all the same. This was achieved through the variance in endings the reader could reach based on their choices.</p>
