<h2>About me:</h2>  
    <p>My name is Axel Ayala Jimenez, I am an Integrated Sciences and Technology Major at UCF. I have a wide range of knowledge and skills gained from both the workforce and coursework. I initially pursued Aerospace Engineering so I have gained a wealth of knowledge in physics and technology, as I transitioned into my current major, I dove into coursework focused on chemistry, as well as digital coursework such as IT fundamentals. Throughout my pursuit of my degree I have been working at Ace Hardware, where is have been developing interpersonal skills within customer service, as well as gaining familiarity with tools which are a great help in the goals I am pursuing.
